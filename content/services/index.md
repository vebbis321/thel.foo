# Details

## iOS

I can make all kinds of iOS applications in Swift, whether it is a UIKit
application supporting older iOS versions like iOS 14, or a purely SwiftUI
application. My preference lately has been building a hybrid with 90% UIKit
and 10% SwiftUI. I also use Combine and Swift Concurrency extensively.


## Firebase

In nearly all the applications I've written, I've used Firebase. I have my own
[Firebase tool](https://github.com/vebbis321/FireThel), created as a Swift package.

I've extensively used Firebase Auth for my authentication flows, whether it is sign in with phone, email, Apple,
Facebook or Google.

I use Firestore to store my users, and if it is a chat application, I use
Firebase RTDB for the chat messages. I prefer to normalize the data so I can
reduce the costs of the user structure and the chat structure.

## Python

I have worked a little bit with the Scrapy framework, and written my own data
[scraper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70287510/scrapy-not-scraping-the-whole-website-even-though-i-find-the-data-with-xpath) that scraped all the MMA-fighters in the world. I of course managed to
get banned from UFC.com ip-address, but I got the data anyway :blush: 


## TypeScript

I have written one [program](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71266520/chat-message-notification-in-firebase-cloud-functions-cant-get-data-from-a-pro) in TypeScript for listening to user
notifications in Cloud Function.
